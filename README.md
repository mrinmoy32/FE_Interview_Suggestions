‚Ä¢ Storage - Cookies, Local, Session

I didn‚Äôt talk of React yet.

I don‚Äôt discourage learning React. Do explore React & it‚Äôs internals, but there are very slim chances to ask, ‚ÄúExplain how React Fiber works‚Äù in Interviews.

You just need to learn & know how to work on React, and it‚Äôs conceptual workflows.

If you‚Äôve noticed in most Machine Coding rounds, Interviewers encourage to use any Library/Framework of your choice (or even Vanilla JS)

Note: It‚Äôs a different thing if you‚Äôre targeting for a dedicated ‚ÄòReact Developer‚Äô role.

You can checkout my One Stop Frontend Projects üî• and join 100+ learners.

Where I‚Äôve taught all of the above fundamentals in depth & applied in 3 Frontend Intensive Projects.
